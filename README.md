# Big Data Processing with Apache Spark

## Overview
This repository contains a Python application for processing and analyzing large-scale datasets using Apache Spark. Leveraging the power of distributed computing, the project encompasses various tasks such as data cleaning, transformation, and running distributed machine learning algorithms.

## Key Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing with Apache Spark
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for understanding dataset characteristics
- Feature engineering and transformation for machine learning
- Model training using Apache Spark's MLlib library
- Model evaluation and performance metrics calculation
- Deployment instructions and documentation for future use
## Additional Features

In addition to the core functionality described above, this project includes the following optional features:

1. **Real-time Data Processing:** Extend the application to support real-time data processing using Apache Spark Streaming.

2. **Integration with External Databases:** Implement connectors to integrate with external databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB for data storage and retrieval.

3. **Advanced Analytics:** Implement advanced analytics functionalities such as anomaly detection, time-series forecasting, or graph processing using Apache Spark's libraries.

4. **Visualization:** Integrate data visualization tools such as Matplotlib or Plotly to create interactive visualizations for exploring and analyzing data.

5. **Scalability:** Optimize the application for scalability by leveraging Apache Spark's distributed computing capabilities to handle even larger datasets and higher workloads.
